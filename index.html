        <h2>About Polar Bears</h2>
        <p>Polar bears are large carnivorous mammals native to the Arctic Circle. They are superbly adapted to life in
          the cold and icy environment of the Arctic.</p>
        <p>Known for their white fur, which provides camouflage in their snowy habitat, polar bears are also excellent
          swimmers and can travel long distances over water.</p>
        <p>They primarily feed on seals, relying on sea ice for hunting. Polar bears are considered marine mammals
          because of their dependence on the ocean.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>Due to climate change and habitat loss, polar bears are classified as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of
          Threatened Species. Several conservation efforts are in place to protect them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monitoring polar bear populations and habitats</li>
          <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change</li>
          <li>Educating communities and raising awareness about polar bear conservation</li>
          <li>Supporting research on polar bear behavior, ecology, and health</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Polar bears are the largest land carnivores in the world.</li>
          <li>They have an excellent sense of smell, which helps them detect seals under the ice from far distances.
          </li>
          <li>Adult male polar bears can weigh up to 1,500 pounds (680 kilograms).</li>
          <li>Polar bears' fur appears white, but it's actually transparent with a hollow core that reflects light.</li>
          <li>They spend most of their lives on sea ice, hunting seals and other marine mammals.</li>
